I'm Katrina Wehr, an instructional designer at Penn State. I came to PSU in 2015 to work at the Smeal College of Business's eLDIG team. Prior to that, I was an instructional technologist at Drexel Universityâ€™s LeBow College of Business in Philadelphia, PA. Before moving to Philadelphia, I worked in various eLearning design roles on a contract basis with private companies and K-12 and higher education institutions throughout Pennsylvania and the mid-Atlantic area, primarily developing courses and materials to train teachers in effective online/technology enhanced instructional strategies.
I earned my B.S. in Secondary Education here at Penn State in 2012 and went on to complete my M.Ed. in Instructional Design & Technology at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. While I was in graduate school I worked as a long-term substitute teacher and journalist. My journalism work has been published in various forms in both local and national news outlets.
